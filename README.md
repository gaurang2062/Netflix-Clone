<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Netflix Clone App built using React JS and YouTube API that allows searching of 10000+ movies and provides  high-quality audio and video streaming.

## Technologies
HTML - CSS - JS - React

## Overview
Although my web app looks and feels like Netflix, it functions differently. Since I can't create a database with full movies of every title, I decided to play movies from YouTube. 


### Demo

- Live Site : https://netflix-youtube.vercel.app
